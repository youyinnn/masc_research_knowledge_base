1. Marginal Effect

   Marginal effects tells us how a dependent variable (outcome) changes when a specific independent variable (explanatory variable) changes. Other covariates are assumed to be held constant. Marginal effects are often calculated when analyzing regression analysis results.

   The marginal effects for binary variables measure discrete change. For continuous variables, they measure the instantaneous rate of change. Both are typically calculated using software packages such as STATA.

   For an independent variable x, we can define the marginal effect to be the partial derivative, with respect to x, of the prediction function f. The derivative (from calculus) gives us the rate of change over an interval which is very, very smallâ€”approaching 0.
